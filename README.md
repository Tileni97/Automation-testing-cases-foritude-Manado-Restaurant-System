Smoke Tests (Test Cases - Smoke Testing.pdf)
These tests verify the essential functions of the website, ensuring it's accessible on various devices and browsers, the navigation menu works, menu categories and sample dishes display correctly, and basic ordering functionality is intact. These tests are crucial for quickly assessing the website's overall health and identifying any major issues early on.

Localization Tests (Test Cases - Localization Testing.pdf)
These tests focus on verifying that the website is properly localized for its target audience. They check if the default language (Bahasa Indonesia) is displayed correctly, if the language switcher functions as expected, and if the English translation is accurate and consistent across all pages. These tests are essential for ensuring a positive user experience for both Indonesian and English-speaking users.
